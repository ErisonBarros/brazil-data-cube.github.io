Jupyter Notebooks
=================


If you want to learn from a practical example, please, take a look at the following Jupyter Notebook: `Jupyter Notebook - Discover and Access to Data Products in Brazil Data Cube <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/stac.py/blob/master/examples/stac.ipynb>`_.


This jupyter notebook will explain step by step how to use the STAC client library to retrieve metadata and access the image collections or data cube collections.


**TODO:** show an image plot from the jupyter notebook
